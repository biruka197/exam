At the time, Hung was not fluent in English, and he reportedly recited some of his dialogue phonetically. In many scenes, Hung did not speak at all, making Martial Law perhaps the only US television series in history that featured so little dialogue from the lead character.","popularity":15.35,"poster_path":"/iLseFnM1UwzHLQxnNTiCqfRMgkx.jpg","first_air_date":"1998-09-26","name":"Martial Law","vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":96},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[18],"id":597,"origin_country":["CA"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Cold Squad","overview":"Cold Squad is a Canadian police procedural television series first broadcast in 1998 that followed the investigations of a part of the Vancouver Police Department Homicide Division tasked with solving cold cases, the titular Cold Squad, as led by Sergeant Ali McCormick.\n\nThe cast of Cold Squad was diverse and changing, McCormick being the only character to appear in all 7 seasons.

Ray Chase in season 7.\n\nBetween the second and third seasons, almost the entire on-screen cast other than Julie Stewart were replaced. This along with the new sets, a significant revamp of the credits and theme music, and even having McCormick's hair change from auburn to dirty-blonde all contributed to a considerable reworking of the series.","popularity":21.764,"poster_path":"/4JC7VvbplEXMGw2jW15QzHqqoN6.jpg","first_air_date":"1998-01-23","name":"Cold Squad","vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":12},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":null,"genre_ids":[18],"id":678,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Justice","overview":"Justice is an American legal drama produced by Jerry Bruckheimer that aired on Fox in the USA and CTV in Canada.

On November 13, 2006, the show was put on hiatus, but two days later the network announced it was shifting it to Fridays at 8:00 to replace the canceled Vanished.\n\nFourteen episodes of the series were ordered, of which 13 episodes were produced.
