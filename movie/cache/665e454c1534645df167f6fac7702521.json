It stars political humorist Stephen Colbert, a former correspondent for The Daily Show with Jon Stewart. The Colbert Report is a spin-off from and counterpart to The Daily Show that comments on politics and the media in a similar way. It satirizes conservative personality-driven political pundit programs, particularly Fox News' The O'Reilly Factor. The show focuses on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\", is a caricature of televised political pundits.\n\nThe Colbert Report has been nominated for seven Primetime Emmy Awards each in 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, two Television Critics Association Awards Awards, and two Satellite Awards. In 2013, it won two Emmys. It has been presented as non-satirical journalism in several instances, including by the Tom DeLay Legal Defense Trust and by Robert Wexler following his interview on the program. The Report received considerable media coverage following its debut on October 17, 2005, for Colbert's coining of the term \"truthiness\", which dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster named its 2006 Word of the Year.","popularity":1005.888,"poster_path":"/pn2CVXjOlR8kY5MgOTJjZ71IM0Q.jpg","first_air_date":"2005-10-17","name":"The Colbert Report","vote_average":6.798,"vote_count":267},{"adult":false,"backdrop_path":"/lswRmm6czR4QTnwXRtacMfyxgJ0.jpg","genre_ids":[10759,18,10764],"id":46707,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"WWE Main Event","overview":"WWE Main Event is a professional wrestling television program produced by WWE that airs on Peacock and streams on Hulu Plus in the United States.
